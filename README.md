## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , I'm Rendani.

I'm a technical writer with over two years of experience based in Madrid, focused on developer documentation and APIs. I'm passionate about improving documentation processes and am a strong advocate for docs-as-code approaches. Most recently, I led an end-to-end documentation migration from Confluence to GitBook.

### Current Focus

- ðŸ”­  Learning GitHub Actions workflows
- ðŸ‘¯ Developing a POS API developer portal
- ðŸŒ± Exploring docs operations and AI applications in technical writing
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: <a href="mailto:rluvhengo@gmail.com">Send email</a>
- âš¡ Fun fact: Nina Simone is my all-time favorite artist and I love painting.
