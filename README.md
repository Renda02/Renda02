## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , I'm Rendani.

I'm a technical writer with over two years of experience based in Madrid, focused on developer documentation and APIs. I'm passionate about improving documentation processes and strongly advocate for docs-as-code best practices. Most recently, I led the Japanese documentation localization project from concept to delivery, collaborating with engineering to build and launch an MVP over 2-sprint cycles. 

### Current Focus

- **API documentation**: Creating a POS API developer portal.
- **AI Prompting**: Best practices for interacting with AI models and AI agents.
- **Docs as Code**: Learning GitHub Actions workflows to automate some daily tasks
- **API documentation**: Creating a POS API developer portal.
- **Docs ops**: Exploring ways to improve docs operations.
- **How to reach me**: <a href="mailto:rluvhengo@gmail.com">Send email</a>
- âš¡ Fun fact: Nina Simone is my all-time favorite artist and I love painting.
